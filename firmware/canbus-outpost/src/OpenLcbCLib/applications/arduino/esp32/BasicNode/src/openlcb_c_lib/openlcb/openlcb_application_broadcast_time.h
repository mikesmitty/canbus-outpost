 * @brief Application-level Broadcast Time Protocol module.
 *
 * @details Provides a fixed-size array of clock slots and the API for the
 * OpenLCB Broadcast Time Protocol.  Supports up to
 * BROADCAST_TIME_TOTAL_CLOCK_COUNT simultaneous clocks (four well-known
 * plus BROADCAST_TIME_MAX_CUSTOM_CLOCKS user-defined clocks).
 *
 * The protocol handler (protocol_broadcast_time_handler.c) updates clock
 * state when time events are received from the network.  This module is
 * optional — applications that do not use broadcast time should not include it.
