 * @brief Random-access list of OpenLCB message pointers.
 *
 * @details Provides a fixed-size array of @ref openlcb_msg_t pointers that supports
 * both indexed access and attribute-based search (source alias, destination alias,
 * and MTI).  Primarily used for multi-frame message assembly where frames must be
 * matched to an in-progress message by sender and type.  Must be initialized after
 * OpenLcbBufferStore_initialize().
